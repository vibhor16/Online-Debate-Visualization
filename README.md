# Online-Debate-Visualization
As part of the CSE 523/524 Advanced Project under Professor Klaus Mueller


This project aims at creating a platform to visualize live debate streams through various visual components.

- YouTube Player - A live video streaming YouTube Player where the debate is getting streamed.

- Tagger - The user can start/stop the video at a given moment. If the user wants to tag the debaters on opposing sides with respect to the topics in discussion in the Topics section, he can stop the video and tag the debaters.
  The tagger also records the direction of verbal attack in the Attack section.
  
- Topics - It is a time series representation of topics discussed by the debater throughout the debate. For instace, it can show that Joe Biden has discussed about the Defence topic at 1:30 minute marker in the debate.

- Attack - It is also a time series representation of verbal attacks by debaters to each other. For instance, if Kamala Harris has verbally attacked Mike at 2:01 minute marker, then it can be seen in the Attack section
